To build:

sudo mkdir /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/7.0/MediaCore/KeyStatus
chown the above dir to yourself, or use chgrp chmod or something else to make it writeable by your user account, so that XCode can copy the compiled effect there without permission problems
open XCode
command-B
